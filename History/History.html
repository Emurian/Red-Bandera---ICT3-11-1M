              Queen frontman Freddie Mercury issues a statement confirming he
              has AIDS and calling for help in fighting the disease. "I felt it
              correct to keep this information private to date to protect the
              privacy of those around me," he writes. "However, the time has
              come now for my friends and fans around the world to know the
              truth and I hope that everyone will join with my doctors and all
              those worldwide in the fight against this terrible disease."
              Mercury dies the next day.
